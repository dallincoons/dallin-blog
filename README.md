# About Me
Looking for a "wizard" or "ninja" programmer is stupid. They don't exist. Look for someone who actually knows what they're doing.

## My Favorite Resources
Simple, forward us the shameful email to *outreachshame@snipcart.com* where it’ll be up for moderation. We kindly ask you to censor any personal information from the email before forwarding it to us. Once your submission is accepted by our team it’ll be published on the site outreachshame.com.

Once a submission is approved, a commit is pushed in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/snipcart/outreachshame). We then use [Forestry](https://forestry.io/#/) to make content editing and publishing easier for our dumb marketing folks. Once the entry is published, the site is built and deployed automatically on Netlify.
